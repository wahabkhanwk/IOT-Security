# 🛡️ Sleepace IoT – STRIDE Threat Model & Pentest

This repo contains a threat model and proof-of-concept attacks targeting a Sleepace IoT device using the STRIDE framework.

## 🔥 Key Findings

- **Spoofing:** MQTT credentials sniffed via Wireshark → Broker access
- **Tampering:** Injected false data to device topics
- **Info Disclosure:** Unencrypted traffic exposes device data
- **DoS:** Broker flooded with 1000+ connections
- **Privilege Escalation:** Captured creds allowed full MQTT control

## 🧪 Tools Used

- Wireshark
- Shodan.io
- Mosquitto (sub/pub)
- Bash scripting

## 🛡️ Mitigations

- Use TLS for MQTT
- Enable authentication & authorization
- Implement logging and rate-limiting
